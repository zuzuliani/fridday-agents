# Tutorial 10: Real-world Applications

## Overview
This tutorial applies the concepts learned in previous sessions to build practical, real-world applications using LangChain and LangGraph. We'll implement four different applications to showcase the versatility and power of these libraries in solving complex problems.

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Tutorials 1-9 in the series
- Strong understanding of LangChain components and LangGraph concepts
- Python 3.7+
- LangChain and LangGraph libraries installed
- Groq API key (for using Groq as the LLM)

## Installation
```bash
   cd langchain-langgraph-starter/Tutorial_10
```

## Contents
1. Building a content moderation system
2. Implementing a language translation service
3. Creating an automated customer support chatbot
4. Developing a text-based game with AI-driven narrative

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository or download the `tutorial_10_real_world_applications.ipynb` file.
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Ensure you have set your Groq API key as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export GROQ_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
   ```
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to build and test each application.
