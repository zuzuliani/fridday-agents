# Tutorial 06: Memory Systems in LangChain

## What you'll learn

1. Types of LangChain memory systems:
   - Buffer Memory
   - Summary Memory
   - Conversation Buffer/Summary Memory
   - Vector Store-Backed Memory
   - Knowledge Graph Memory

2. Implementing memory systems:
   - Basic conversation memory
   - Long-term memory with summaries
   - Combined memory approaches
   - Knowledge graph memory for complex relationships

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Tutorials 1-5
- Python and Jupyter Notebooks
- Groq API key (https://console.groq.com)
