# Tutorial 2: Working with Language Models in LangChain

Welcome to the second tutorial in our LangChain and LangGraph series! In this tutorial, we'll dive deeper into working with language models in LangChain, focusing on the Groq LLM.

## What you'll learn

1. How to connect to different language models in LangChain
2. Creating and using prompt templates
3. Building simple prompt chains
4. Handling model responses
5. Best practices for prompt engineering

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Tutorial 1: Introduction to LangChain
- Basic understanding of Python and Jupyter Notebooks
- A Groq API key (sign up at https://console.groq.com)

## Getting Started

### 1. Ensure Virtual Environment is Activated

#### For Linux/macOS:
```bash
cd langchain-langgraph-starter
source venv/bin/activate
cd Tutorial_02
```

#### For Windows:
```cmd
cd langchain-langgraph-starter
.\venv\Scripts\activate
cd Tutorial_02
```

### 2. Launch Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook Tutorial_02_Working_with_Language_Models.ipynb
```
