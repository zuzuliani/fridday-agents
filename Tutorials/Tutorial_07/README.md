# Tutorial 07: Introduction to LangGraph

Welcome to the seventh tutorial in our series. LangGraph is an extension of LangChain for building stateful, multi-step workflows.

## What you'll learn

1. LangGraph fundamentals
   - Graph-based workflows vs. LangChain chains
   - Nodes, edges, and state management
   - Graph compilation and execution

2. Building workflows with LangGraph
   - Creating nodes with custom functions
   - Defining edges and transitions
   - Managing conversation state
   - Visualizing graph flows

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Tutorials 1-6
- Python 3.7+
- Groq API key (https://console.groq.com)

## Getting Started

### 1. Ensure Virtual Environment is Activated

#### Linux/macOS:
```bash
cd langchain-langgraph-starter
source venv/bin/activate
cd Tutorial_07
```

#### Windows:
```cmd
cd langchain-langgraph-starter
.\venv\Scripts\activate
cd Tutorial_07
```

### 2. Launch Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook Tutorial_07_introduction_to_langgraph.ipynb
```

## What's Included

### Core Components
- Tutorial notebook with practical examples
- Sample conversation workflow implementation
- Graph visualization tools
- State management examples

### Key Concepts Covered

#### Graph Structure

- Edge definition and flow control
- State typing with TypedDict
- Graph compilation process

#### Practical Implementation
- Conversational agent workflow
- State management in conversations
- Interactive user input handling
- Graph visualization with Mermaid

## Next Steps

After completing this tutorial:
1. Experiment with complex graph structures
2. Add conditional branching
3. Implement custom node types
4. Build multi-agent systems

Stay tuned for Tutorial 08 where we'll explore advanced LangGraph patterns.
