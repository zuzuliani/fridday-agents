# Tutorial 09: Combining LangChain and LangGraph

## Overview
This tutorial demonstrates how to effectively combine LangChain components with LangGraph flows to create powerful, flexible AI applications. We'll build a sophisticated task planning and execution system that leverages the strengths of both libraries.

## What you'll learn

1. Integration Fundamentals:
   - Combining LangChain components with LangGraph flows
   - Building hybrid systems leveraging both libraries
   - Optimizing performance in complex applications
   - Handling state between components

2. System Architecture:
   - Component integration patterns
   - State management across libraries
   - Error handling and recovery
   - Asynchronous operations

3. Task Planning System:
   - Intelligent task decomposition
   - Sequential execution control
   - Result aggregation 
   - Progress monitoring

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Tutorials 1-8
- Strong understanding of LangChain components and LangGraph concepts
- Python 3.7+
- Groq API key
