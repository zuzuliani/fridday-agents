# Tutorial 04: Agents in LangChain

Welcome to the fourth tutorial in our LangChain and LangGraph series! In this tutorial, we'll explore the concept of Agents in LangChain, which are autonomous entities capable of using tools and making decisions to accomplish tasks.

## What you'll learn

1. Understanding the agent architecture in LangChain
2. Exploring different types of agents:
   - Zero-shot React Agent
   - Conversational Agent
   - Plan-and-Execute Agent
3. Creating custom tools for agents
4. Implementing a multi-tool agent for task solving

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Tutorials 1-3
- Familiarity with Python and Jupyter Notebooks
- A Groq API key (sign up at https://console.groq.com)

## Getting Started

### 1. Ensure Virtual Environment is Activated

#### For Linux/macOS:

cd langchain-langgraph-starter
source venv/bin/activate
cd Tutorial_04
```

#### For Windows:
```cmd
cd langchain-langgraph-starter
.\venv\Scripts\activate
cd Tutorial_04
```

### 2. Launch Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook Tutorial_04_Agents_in_LangChain.ipynb
```
