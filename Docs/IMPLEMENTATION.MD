  - [ ] Specify supported data sources (e.g., Supabase, Redis)
- [ ] Implement Q&A agent core logic
  - [ ] Create agent class/module
  - [ ] Integrate with Supabase for context retrieval
  - [ ] Integrate with Redis for short-term memory
  - [ ] Add prompt/response handling (LangChain/LangGraph)
- [ ] Integrate agent with FastAPI endpoints
  - [ ] Create API route for Q&A agent
  - [ ] Add authentication/authorization checks
- [ ] Test Q&A agent functionality
  - [ ] Unit tests for agent logic
